## Profile

My professional profile could be defined as a “all terrain” person. I come to Operations / SRE / DevOps from the software development field, through the unknown and tough territories of system integrations.

My experience includes several positions, from project management and team lead, to software and cloud architecture, and some other *not so common* contexts, for example embedded industrial systems development, and of course working in a wide array of business like retail, Telco, Government, etc

## A little More About me

Years ago I could be called a mountaineer, although I always carry the call of the mountain with me. I'm a true believer in the FOSS, DevOps avocate, and agile thinking, you could define my goal as help to make the things happen working as a team.

## Personal Achievements

* I decoded the Siemens S5/7 communications protocol to finish my dissertation (they denied my access to the code)
* Learned "the hard way",  the best technical project can be the worst product
* I survived to the work load of a "big" social network in the SRE department being a middle-aged man surrounded by millennials
* I’m quite proud having helped to made a complex system for a really big Telco with only 5 person team, which became a big competitor in the MVNO/MVNE context back then
* I won a honorific mention making a home automation system in 1996 (no, it wasn’t the time of IoT back in those days)
* I’ve learned to solve the Rubik’s cube after having turned forty
